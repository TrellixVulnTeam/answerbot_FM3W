As a result, overfitting may fail to fit additional data, and this may affect the accuracy of predicting future observations.\n...\n[highlight]\nOverfitting can be identified by checking validation metrics such as accuracy and loss. The validation metrics usually increase until a point where they stagnate or start declining when the model is affected by overfitting. During an upward trend, the model seeks a good fit, which, when achieved, causes the trend to start declining or stagnate.\n[\\highlight]\n...\nDetecting overfitting is almost impossible before you test the data. It can help address the inherent characteristic of overfitting, which is the inability to generalize data sets.

Therefore, the process of data modeling involves professional data modelers working closely with business stakeholders, as well as potential users of the information system.\n[\\highlight]\n...\nData modeling techniques and methodologies are used to model data in a standard, consistent, predictable manner in order to manage it as a resource. The use of data modeling standards is strongly recommended for all projects requiring a standard means of defining and analyzing data within an organization, e.g., using data modeling:\n* to assist business analysts, programmers, testers, manual writers, IT package selectors, engineers, managers, related organizations and clients to understand and use an agreed upon semi-formal model that encompasses the concepts of the organization and how they relate to one another\n* to manage data as a resource\n* for the integration of information systems\n* for designing databases/data warehouses (aka data repositories)\n...\nData modeling is also used as a technique for detailing business [requirements](/wiki/Requirement \"Requirement\") for specific [databases](/wiki/Database \"Database\"). It is sometimes called _database modeling_ because a [data model](/wiki/Data_model \"Data model\") is eventually implemented in a database.[\\[4\\]](#cite_note-WBD04-4)\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/3-4_Data_model_roles.svg/320px-3-4_Data_model_roles.svg.png)\n...\nData models represent information areas of interest.

They usually start with existing data structures forms, fields on application screens, or reports.

As a result, overfitting may fail to fit additional data, and this may affect the accuracy of predicting future observations.\n...\n[highlight]\nOverfitting can be identified by checking validation metrics such as accuracy and loss. The validation metrics usually increase until a point where they stagnate or start declining when the model is affected by overfitting. During an upward trend, the model seeks a good fit, which, when achieved, causes the trend to start declining or stagnate.\n[\\highlight]\n...\nDetecting overfitting is almost impossible before you test the data. It can help address the inherent characteristic of overfitting, which is the inability to generalize data sets.
